# Pre-plan index

Status: **grand-architect interview / evidence collection with accepted program
spine**.

This directory does not contain the project plan. It defines how we will earn
one. The immediate task is to discover exclusions, convert the surviving intent
into measurable invariants, and design fair experiments before choosing a core,
GUI framework, index store, semantic pipeline, or plugin ABI.

The following parent-level artifacts remain deliberately absent until the
interview supplies their inputs:

- `INVARIANTS.md` — measurable behavior, performance, privacy, and UX laws;
- `CAPABILITY_MODEL.md` — core/platform/plugin ownership of every capability;
- `PLAN.md` — only after the pre-plan exit gate passes.

Accepted partial-spine decisions already live under `../decisions/`; they do
not imply that the complete parent plan or every component choice is closed.

## Current facts

- Product name: **File Manager**.
- Suite/distribution name: **Malkuth**. Mission: **Curious, Concise, Friendly.**
- Target systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Product stance: local-first, fast, quiet, simple, inspectable, scriptable.
- Visual lineage: classic Windows Explorer (roughly XP/7 through restrained
  NT 7–10 idioms), NeXTSTEP, Windows Watercolor, and turn-of-the-millennium
  Encarta—rendered crisply rather than imitated as a low-resolution skin.
- Core surfaces: GUI, CLI, and a small AI-interrogatable local API.
- Core search: persistent economical indexing plus exact, lexical, structural,
  and eventually local semantic retrieval.
- Core does not search the web or a web store.
- File handlers, icons, previews, sorting, and plugins require explicit product
  models rather than uncontrolled inheritance from host-shell behavior.
- File Manager itself will not rely on .NET, Java, Godot, or a bundled browser
  engine. GUI.Forms and the end-user surface are disciplined C++; Orchestrator and
  hostile plugin supervision are Rust; the opt-in indexing/search service is a
  standalone Go engine with purpose-built storage and retrieval machinery.
  Mature databases remain mandatory measurement controls rather than its
  production backend.
- The main surface is a single location-oriented window: collapsible tree,
  content, and collapsible preview/properties sections. No tabs and no dual pane.
- Persistent side panels belong only to File Manager and its embedded picker/
  browser projection. Paint, Text Editor, Games, and other apps use owned popup
  dialogs for secondary tools.

Anything not recorded as GIVEN or DECIDED remains an open question or candidate.

## Interview loop

1. Answer questions by ID, in any order or batch size.
2. Answers are recorded as GIVEN constraints or explicit deferrals.
3. Contradictions are surfaced, never silently resolved.
4. New questions are added where an answer exposes a hidden tradeoff.
5. Only closed constraints become experiment gates or decision criteria.

The most useful answer is often “absolutely not,” followed by the failure mode
that makes it unacceptable.

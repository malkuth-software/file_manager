# File Manager program map

Status: **DECIDED repository topology and negotiated integration order** under
[`ADR-003`](../decisions/ADR-003-ORCHESTRATOR-INTEGRATION-AUTHORITY-AND-BOOTSTRAP.md),
[`ADR-004`](../decisions/ADR-004-FRONTEND-001-LOCATION-AND-OPENING-GATE.md), and
[`ADR-006`](../decisions/ADR-006-ORCHESTRATOR-CORE-1-0-FRONTEND-BOOTSTRAP.md),
with Engine search readiness corrected by
[`ADR-008`](../decisions/ADR-008-CATALOGUE-INDEPENDENT-LIVE-SEARCH.md) and suite
identity/release horizons established by
[`ADR-012`](../decisions/ADR-012-MALKUTH-SUITE-IDENTITY-AND-RELEASE-HORIZONS.md),
with future utility scope and surface topology established by
[`ADR-013`](../decisions/ADR-013-FUTURE-UTILITY-SCOPE-AND-SURFACE-TOPOLOGY.md).
ADR-021 supersedes physical repository ownership: GUI.Forms is a pinned
source submodule; Engine and Orchestrator share the backend repository. Their
semantic ownership and capability gates remain unchanged.

This is the parent routing document; component details remain governed by each
subproject's records and evidence gates.

## Components and current permission

| Component | Path | Role | Current permission |
|---|---|---|---|
| GUI.Forms | `../gui_forms/` | Retained custom-rendered C++ UI framework and bindings | Active implementation toward a semicomplete, inspectable framework release |
| Web.Forms | `../web_forms/` | Bounded browser-valid HTML/CSS authoring profile and two-stage Python generator of C++17-compatible code over public GUI.Forms | Stage 1/descriptor Stage 2 dogfood open under Web.Forms ADR-003; production GUI.Forms adapter remains gated |
| Engine | `../backend/engine/` | Go catalogue-independent live search, exact catalogue, index, retrieval, and core Kolmogrov candidate integration | Active implementation toward a mostly running standalone service; required live-query lane open under ADR-008 |
| Kolmogrov | `../kolmogrov/` | Formal and empirical fixed-width perceptual-similarity program | Active independent research and conformance work |
| Orchestrator | `../backend/orchestrator/` | Headless Rust integration authority, capability/availability map, control plane, hives, settings, handlers, command/CLI authority, plugin supervision, and platform policy | Active implementation toward Orchestrator Core 1.0; independent of GUI.Forms |
| File Manager frontend | `../frontend/` | Visual C++ end-user program built on GUI.Forms and bootstrapped by Orchestrator | Architect direction recorded 2026-08-07; Frontend 001 waits for Orchestrator Core 1.0 and GUI.Forms FM0 go-ahead |
| Plugin Runtime research | `../plugin_runtime/` | Earlier containment and capability study | Frozen source material; implementation moves into Orchestrator's plugin-supervisor work |
| Malkuth release program | `../malkuth/` | Suite manifest, public mission, documentation, installers, website and release acceptance | Planning open; implementation waits on dogfood/release-artifact gates |
| Paint | `../paint/` | Future direct bitmap/clipart application | Architect interview and paper design open; implementation gated |
| Text Editor | `../text_editor/` | Future plain-text/configuration application | Architect interview and paper design open; implementation gated |
| Games | `../games/` | Nine-module deterministic game collection and GUI.Forms dogfood consumer | Architect interview and paper design open; implementation gated |
| Lexicon | `../lexicon/` | Exact local dictionary/corpus provider and Crossword source | Source/contract research and paper design open; implementation gated |

`orchestrator/` is both the product component's repository path and the home of
the canonical cross-project contract registry.

## Future first-party consumers

**GIVEN:** the same backbone will later support a classic-Paint descendant, a
plain-text/configuration **Text Editor**, and a deliberately small **Games**
collection. They are consumers, not new
authorities and not prerequisites for Frontend 001. File Manager will produce a
bounded reusable Document Picker surface for them; Orchestrator owns the
selection-session/application-profile semantics, and GUI.Forms owns the modal,
help, clipboard, and drag mechanics. See
[`APPLICATION_BACKBONE_AND_DOCUMENT_PICKER.md`](APPLICATION_BACKBONE_AND_DOCUMENT_PICKER.md).

**DECIDED:** persistent side panels are reserved to File Manager and its bounded
embedded picker/browser projection. Paint, Text Editor, Games, and other apps
use owned popup dialogs for secondary tools. Lexicon is a provider rather than
an ordinary windowed application. See
[`FUTURE_SCOPE_LEDGER.md`](FUTURE_SCOPE_LEDGER.md).

Their planning tasks may start now. Each application/provider is required to spend its first
architect turns closing questions and recording decisions before any code; see
the local `FUTURE_THREAD_HANDOFF.md`. Their implementation and Malkuth release
membership remain separate explicit gates.

## Authority map

- The filesystem and platform file identity remain authoritative for files.
- The Go engine owns exact catalogue observations, retrieval mechanics, and the
  required bounded catalogue-independent traversal provision in ADR-008.
- The Kolmogrov channel proposes fuzzy/structural candidates; it does not own
  file identity or personal semantic memory.
- Orchestrator owns the meaning, version, capability, and conformance record for every
  cross-project API/ABI. That ownership does not imply every hot call must be
  proxied through an Orchestrator process.
- Orchestrator owns durable non-file knowledge: semantic/provider hives, settings,
  handler registry, plugin grants and lifecycle, CLI/command grammar, and
  platform-integration policy.
- GUI.Forms owns rendering and retained control behavior, not product policy.
- Web.Forms owns its source profile, validation, lowering, and generated-source semantics; GUI.Forms remains authoritative for retained control/runtime behavior.
- File Manager owns end-user composition and interaction. It is a client, not
  the hidden authority for Orchestrator or engine state.
- Lexicon owns lexical source/package interpretation and lookup implementation;
  Orchestrator owns its provider meaning and result merge; Engine does not own
  dictionary senses.
- Games owns deterministic rules, solvers/opponents and animation commands;
  neither Orchestrator nor GUI.Forms owns game truth.

## Delivery order

1. GUI.Forms, Web.Forms dogfood, the Go engine, and Kolmogrov continue independently while
   publishing evidence and answering explicit interface proposals.
2. Orchestrator builds its provider-independent contract/lifecycle/availability
   kernel and proposes required interfaces in each affected project's notes.
3. Producers reply and Orchestrator reconciles each edge; adapters, hives,
   settings, handlers, command/CLI services, plugin supervision, and platform
   policy open behind their own fixture-backed gates.
4. Orchestrator advances independently to the Core 1.0 bootstrap profile while
   GUI.Forms advances independently to its FM0 consumption snapshot.
5. After both are available and the architect explicitly directs work to begin,
   File Manager Frontend 001 bootstraps against the live Orchestrator and
   consumes GUI.Forms in-process.
6. Kolmogrov yields admitted work to Engine independently. Real Engine and
   other provider capabilities join through their own negotiated snapshots.
7. After cross-platform File Manager dogfood proves the claimed system,
   Malkuth release work opens for native installers, versioned online
   documentation, polished website captures, and a manifest-backed 1.0.
8. Malkuth 2.0 performs stable-call internal tightening and admits the hostile
   plugin reef plus explicitly paired LAN file availability; 3.0 adds formal
   verification/hardening, wider platform/touch/config/font support and
   app-store distribution work.
9. Paint, Text Editor, Games, Lexicon, Archive Viewer, and Image Converter join
   release manifests only through their independent gates. Their plans do not
   silently widen or block File Manager 1.0.

The exact gates and artifacts are in
[`orchestrator/planning/DELIVERY_SEQUENCE.md`](../backend/orchestrator/planning/DELIVERY_SEQUENCE.md)
and [`frontend/planning/DEPENDENCY_GATES.md`](../frontend/planning/DEPENDENCY_GATES.md).

## Cross-project change rule

Each producer may freely evolve private implementation details inside its own
boundary. Orchestrator places proposed cross-project calls, events,
capabilities, errors, identifiers, and lifecycles in that project's
`ORCHESTRATOR_INTERFACE_NEGOTIATION.md`; the project replies and Orchestrator
reconciles the canonical contract. Subprojects may also originate proposals
under `orchestrator/proposals/`.
No C++ layout, Rust enum, Go struct, pointer, callback, platform handle, or
storage representation becomes an ABI merely because one implementation
currently uses it.

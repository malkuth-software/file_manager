# Formalization boundary

Freeze mathematical definitions in `docs/FORMAL_PROGRAM.md` and paper proofs in
the proof ledger before selecting a proof assistant encoding. The initial likely
targets are finite sequences, sparse feature maps, channel kernels, deletion
survival, multi-address collision models, and quantization bounds.

Every formal file must name the theorem ID it closes. Generated proof artifacts
and toolchain locks belong here; exploratory algebra belongs under a named
experiment until its definitions stabilize.

`PROOF_LEDGER.md` means the definitions, quantifiers, proof, exclusions, and
finite support are reviewable; it does not mean formal verification or owner
acceptance.

# File Manager design DNA 006

Status: **DECIDED visual constitution for Frontend 001 under ADR-004, assembled
from GIVEN owner direction, accepted local verdicts, and OBSERVED external
design-framework discipline. Its individual CANDIDATE and HYPOTHESIS records
remain unresolved; it does not select GUI.Forms APIs or implementation tokens.**

Date: 2026-08-05.

Companion surface:
[`frontend-concept-atlas.html`](frontend-concept-atlas.html), state `07 DNA`.

**Superseding owner correction (2026-08-07):** path editing now lives inline in
one vertically dense continuous chevron breadcrumb cascade. The terminal
pull-down/full-path matrix is no longer authoritative as the edit surface. See
[`../OWNER_DIRECTION_2026-08-07.md`](../OWNER_DIRECTION_2026-08-07.md).

Latest owner verdicts:
[`DESIGN_DNA_VERDICTS_007.md`](DESIGN_DNA_VERDICTS_007.md).

## Purpose

This document changes the unit of visual design from a screenshot preference to
an inspectable decision. File Manager should be coherent for the same reason a
good operating system is coherent: each visible behavior descends from a small
set of promises, every exception is named, and a new surface can be derived
without copying an old screen.

**GIVEN:** Design DNA 006 is the derivation and review authority for Frontend
001. Every nuance must remain individually reviewable. An attractive but
unprincipled choice is design debt. A principled choice without evidence remains
a hypothesis or candidate. A visual decision does not become architecture until
its proper decision gate is satisfied.

## Epistemic pipeline

Every visual decision record uses this path:

```text
owner constraint / observed need
    → governing principle
    → candidate rule
    → deterministic specimen
    → counterexample and accessibility audit
    → owner verdict
    → measured implementation gate, if implementation is later authorized
```

Each record contains:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ID and object | one reviewable visual or behavioral question |
| Status | GIVEN, OBSERVED, MEASURED, HYPOTHESIS, CANDIDATE, REJECTED, or DECIDED |
| Principle | the higher promise that constrains the answer |
| Rule | what future surfaces should do by default |
| Evidence | local verdict IDs, program constraints, or named external guidance |
| Specimen | a deterministic comparison, including inactive/error/focus states |
| Failure test | a condition that disproves or rejects the rule |
| Reversal | which token, asset, or composition boundary changes if rejected |

No record may use “modern,” “clean,” “native,” “intuitive,” “fast,” or
“professional” as its justification. Those words require a named mechanism or
measurement.

## The sixteen governing principles

### DNA-01 — Objects before containers

Files, folders, volumes, results, properties, and operations are the subjects.
Chrome explains or acts on them; it does not become the subject. Color and
material richness concentrate in object identity and exceptional state.

### DNA-02 — One location is one place

A window represents one current location. Path, tree, content, selection, and
status must agree about that place. Search and criteria may produce virtual
folders, but their derivation remains visible.

### DNA-03 — Structure must be honest

Visual boundaries correspond to actual differences in role, ownership, or
layer. No separator exists merely to decorate. No two semantic regions are
merged merely to appear minimal.

### DNA-04 — Material must explain behavior

Raised means actionable; inset means editable or instrumented; calm plane means
content; shadow means real overlap. The global light is consistent. Depth is a
behavioral vocabulary, not a skin.

### DNA-05 — The probable path is immediate

Common operations are visible, direct, and require little memory. Less probable
power remains available through menus, contextual surfaces, autocomplete, or
inspectable expansion. This is KDE's “simple by default, powerful when needed”
and Windows' “design for the probable” translated into File Manager.

### DNA-06 — State is locally evident

Selection, keyboard focus, editability, activity, unavailability, and authority
appear where they matter. Success normally changes the affected object instead
of producing a redundant announcement.

### DNA-07 — Redundancy requires independent value

The same fact may appear twice only when the representations answer different
questions or survive different failure modes. Full recent breadcrumb stacks are
valid redundancy because each row proves an independent destination. Repeated
item counts in adjacent bars are not.

### DNA-08 — Richness is geographically budgeted

Daily content stays calm. The title may carry identity, icons may carry object
material, instruments may become deeper, and rare ceremony may become a world.
Richness is assigned to loci instead of sprayed across every surface.

### DNA-09 — Dense is not cramped

Density removes travel and memory load; cramped layouts reduce target clarity,
legibility, or grouping. Every reduction in space must preserve a hit boundary,
reading rhythm, and focus path.

### DNA-10 — Time must remain honest

State changes promptly. Motion explains causality, continuity, or activity; it
never delays navigation for spectacle. Progress distinguishes known work from
unknown work and exposes exact stages when available.

### DNA-11 — Color is relational and scarce

Foreground/background pairs are the primitive. Color communicates hierarchy or
semantic state and never acts as the sole carrier of meaning. Neutral structure
protects the salience of selection, objects, warnings, and live data.

### DNA-12 — Familiar behavior, authored appearance

Keyboard, pointer, selection, editing, menus, focus, drag/drop, and window
behavior remain conventional across target platforms. File Manager may have a
custom visual voice without inventing gratuitous interaction grammar.

### DNA-13 — Adaptation preserves relationships

DPI, font size, locale, RTL, contrast, reduced motion, window size, inactive
state, and alternate color schemes may alter metrics. They may not destroy the
relationships that explain hierarchy or authority.

### DNA-14 — Performance is part of appearance

The interface should feel attached to input. Immediate press feedback, stable
geometry, bounded invalidation, and absence of decorative startup work are
visual requirements. Polish cannot borrow from responsiveness.

### DNA-15 — Every external contribution is domesticated

Plugins contribute validated facts, commands, and object kinds. The house
system assigns their controls, materials, language, icons, failure treatment,
and accessibility. No plugin imports a competing visual constitution.

### DNA-16 — Exceptions are explicit and reversible

An exceptional material, animation, or topology names its scope and reason.
Tokens and specimens identify the reversal seam. Accumulated unnamed exceptions
are a failed design system.

## Primary-source framework survey

The following sources are used for decision discipline, not visual imitation.

| Framework | OBSERVED discipline | File Manager adoption | Boundary/rejection |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apple HIG | hierarchy, harmony, consistency; focus and selection are explicit states; toolbars group deliberate frequent actions | relationships between content, control, selection, and focus must survive scale and state | current Apple materials, translucency, and device geometry are not the house style |
| Windows desktop/Fluent | design for the probable; place commands on the right surface; feedback should be natural and nonredundant; coherence spans layout, interaction, visual style, window behavior | probability governs command prominence; content, menu, ribbon, context, and dialog have different command budgets | web-like cards, disappearing affordances, Mica as identity, and touch density are not imported |
| KDE | simple by default, powerful when needed; customization supports diverse workflows; status messages are minimized and actionable; exhaustive modality testing | visible common path plus inspectable expert power; explicit error ownership; test keyboard, pointer, color, text size, sound-off, screen reader, reduced motion | configurability does not justify unstable defaults or toolbar accretion |
| GNOME | design for people; make each view simple; reduce effort; be considerate; progressively disclose less-common actions | prevent overload and interruption; shorten language; keep common actions close | single-purpose minimalism does not erase professional file-management power |
| elementary OS | text is brief and translatable; ellipsis predicts further input; disabled versus hidden has semantic consequences; feedback escalates from toast to infobar to dialog; icons are redrawn per size | establish writing, visibility, feedback, and icon-size rules before styling | header-bar topology, icon-only preference, and automatic-save policy are not inherited |
| Enlightenment/EFL | theme, layout, and animation data are separated through a theme abstraction; widget styles can vary without changing the widget's purpose | supports the hypothesis that semantic role and visual construction are separate axes | EFL architecture and animated jewel excess are not selected dependencies or defaults |
| RISC OS Style Guide | “style” includes appearance, functionality, integration, keyboard conventions, and consistency that accelerates transfer learning | visual governance covers behavior, language, input, and interoperability—not CSS alone | RISC OS desktop topology and historical metrics are not copied |
| classic Macintosh lineage | direct manipulation, visible results, consistency, user control, forgiveness, and concrete metaphor established the constitutional model for GUI decisions | object identity, immediate feedback, undo, and learnable placement are first-order rules | literal classic-Mac chrome or single-button assumptions are irrelevant |
| Office/Word ribbon | stable tabs/groups/commands, group captions, visible common actions, and controlled overflow | command shelf uses quiet group structure and labelled priority | flat monoline iconography and generic document-app commands are rejected |

## Design-layer constitution

Visual values descend in this order. A lower layer may refine but not contradict
a higher one.

```text
product truth and authority
  → interaction promise
    → information hierarchy
      → spatial topology
        → control/material role
          → state grammar
            → color pair
              → typography/icon detail
                → motion and sound
```

This ordering prevents a color theme from changing topology, a plugin from
changing interaction, or a bevel from implying an action where none exists.

## Nuance decision ledger

The ledger is deliberately granular. “Direction” is the current principled
default. “Gate/debt” names what still prevents closure.

### Frame, layer, and activation

| ID | Object | Status | Direction | Gate/debt |

## Current unprincipled-debt register

These are not hidden behind polished screenshots.

1. **Typography implementation:** Portsmouth Rapids versus bundled body roles
   are GIVEN, but platform mapping, fallback, hinting, shaping, and metrics are
   not demonstrated.
2. **Responsive geometry:** content-aware reflow, priority collapse, and the
   150 × 150 minimum are GIVEN; the atlas still uses fixed metrics and has no
   derived breakpoints.
3. **Command state coverage:** permanent and context-only membership is GIVEN,
   but selection, multi-selection, disabled, and narrow-window states are not
   completely drawn.
4. **Hover dependence:** search expansion currently works best with a pointer;
   keyboard focus, click pinning, and touch disclosure need equal specimens.
5. **Match percentage:** the visual precision may overstate ranking calibration.
6. **Criteria modules:** the instrument-rack direction is GIVEN, but cost,
   add/edit/error/keyboard, live, and staged-Apply states are incomplete.
7. **Collapse actuators:** the proximity-expanding flat grip is GIVEN; hit
   geometry, keyboard timing, and reduced-motion behavior remain unmeasured.
8. **Scrolling:** several mockup regions hide overflow; this is not a legitimate
   scrolling decision.
9. **Participation states:** key, secondary-but-participating, drag-proximate,
   and genuinely deactivated surfaces do not yet form a complete state matrix.
10. **Drag and drop:** conventional host behavior is GIVEN, but no source,
    destination, cross-window, cross-process, cross-volume, or collision state
    is drawn.
11. **Dialogs and errors:** modal ordinary failures and a complex-merge drawer
    are GIVEN, but confirmation, undo, collision, permission, handler, and
    degraded-service specimens remain absent.
12. **Empty/loading:** empty folder, unavailable preview, cold engine, rebuild,
    and slow volume states are absent.
13. **Texture:** graphite texture is CSS-authored by eye, not frequency/contrast
    measured against target renderers and display scales.
14. **Sound production:** the state/location-only vocabulary and default-on
    policy are GIVEN; assets, mixing, coalescing, volume, and silence testing
    remain absent.
15. **Token integrity:** the planning CSS contains hard-coded values that do not
    yet descend cleanly from semantic roles.

Each debt item receives a standalone pane in the DNA laboratory before it can
silently harden into product behavior.

## Decision review order

The laboratory should not review random cosmetic atoms. The next sequence is:

1. layer and role grammar;
2. active/inactive/focus/selection state matrix;
3. responsive topology and pane collapse behavior;
4. command probability and overflow;
5. typography and density;
6. object grid, drag/drop, and details view;
7. search expansion and relevance honesty;
8. criteria construction;
9. failure, progress, and undo;
10. accessibility equivalence;
11. motion and sound;
12. texture, color, and final ornamental refinement.

This sequence prevents late visual polish from legitimizing an unresolved
behavioral foundation.

# Frontend 001 specification

Status: **implementation and M4 dogfood active; opening predicate passed under
ADR-004, ADR-006, ADR-016, and the 2026-08-10 owner direction**.

Frontend 001 is the first executable File Manager application slice. Its
opening and exit evidence produced the protected-root product spine; later
ADRs have since added real operations, settings, search, trusted commands,
previews, and the reusable picker without changing its GUI.Forms-consumer
boundary. This record does not promote daily roots or distribution packaging.

## Opening predicate

Implementation begins only after all three are recorded:

1. Orchestrator Core 1.0 is available through the real frontend bootstrap edge.
2. GUI.Forms gives a named go-ahead for the consumption surface below.
3. The grand architect explicitly directs File Manager frontend work to begin.

All three predicates are satisfied. Orchestrator Core 1.0 has accepted installed
macOS evidence, GUI.Forms published
`gui-forms-fm0-macos-arm64-2026-08-10`, and
[`OWNER_DIRECTION_2026-08-10.md`](OWNER_DIRECTION_2026-08-10.md) explicitly
opens implementation and M4 dogfood. Later provider/promotion gates remain
independent; see [`TOTAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](TOTAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

Engine, plugin execution, semantic facts, and Kolmogrov readiness are not part
of this predicate. Their actual states are supplied by the live Orchestrator as
available, degraded, unavailable, deferred, or stubbed.

## Orchestrator bootstrap surface

Frontend 001 starts and negotiates a user-scoped Orchestrator Core 1.0 session
before constructing provider-dependent application state. It consumes:

- release and compatible-contract discovery;
- lifecycle generation and restart/shutdown state;
- immutable capability/availability snapshots;
- explicit unavailable/stubbed provider reasons;
- the registered direct-Engine fallback declaration;
- bounded version mismatch, deadline, cancellation, and disconnect behavior.

Tests may replay the exact Core 1.0 fixtures. Product startup does not replace
this authority with a frontend-owned schema.

## GUI.Forms consumption surface

The GUI.Forms go-ahead must identify a buildable, dependency-facing snapshot
that supports the 001 shell without private-header access. At minimum it must
cover:

- application, window, retained-tree, UI-thread, ownership, and shutdown
  lifecycle;
- deterministic layout, resize, DPI/scale, damage, input, focus, and keyboard
  traces;
- the controls or compositional primitives needed for command shelf, path and
  search instruments, collapsible panes, object field, status, and overlays;
- text display and the bounded editing behavior actually admitted to 001;
- PNG/resource, semantic naming, theme/state, and headless-test seams;
- a clean CMake consumption path and named C ABI/C++ wrapper version.

The complete requested substrate and its FM0/FM1/FM2/FMX staging are recorded
in
[`../../gui_forms/planning/FILE_MANAGER_CONSUMER_CAPABILITY_PROFILE.md`](../../gui_forms/planning/FILE_MANAGER_CONSUMER_CAPABILITY_PROFILE.md).
Frontend 001 requires the admitted FM0 subset, not every later row.

If GUI.Forms excludes a feature, 001 narrows or records a follow-up. The
frontend does not implement a shadow widget framework.

## Delivered application slice

001 delivers an independently buildable C++ application under `frontend/` with:

- one location-oriented window; no tabs and no dual content panes;
- Watercolor identity and Office Pearl command zones above a subtle
  middle-value Workshop Graphite navigation chassis;
- a compact labelled task shelf;
- back, forward, up, one dense chevron breadcrumb with a first-order inline path
  editor, and a separate scoped-search instrument;
- collapsible tree and selection/properties panes around the sole central file
  surface;
- deterministic sample file objects, selection, focus, status, availability,
  and empty/degraded states;
- the Sapphire Dusk atmosphere as the default;
- semantic icon slots following Fluent Color plus original House Material
  direction, using only locally generated or provenance-cleared 001 assets;
- deterministic keyboard, pointer, resize, pane-collapse, activation, and
  shutdown scenarios;
- explicit frontend ports for filesystem and Engine data, plus the real
  Orchestrator Core 1.0 bootstrap client.

The inline path editor, search-result expansion, direct property editing,
drag/drop, motion, sound, and other debt-ledger objects enter 001 only to the
extent supported by the GUI.Forms go-ahead and an existing GIVEN rule. The
earlier pulled-down path matrix is not the primary edit surface. Missing behavior
is labelled, not improvised.

## Design authority

[`visual/DESIGN_DNA_006.md`](visual/DESIGN_DNA_006.md) is the normative design
constitution for this slice. Its sixteen principles and records marked GIVEN
or DECIDED are requirements. CANDIDATE and HYPOTHESIS entries remain deliberate
experiments with named failure/reversal points.

The primary supporting records are:

- [`visual/FRONTEND_DESIGN_BRIEF_001.md`](visual/FRONTEND_DESIGN_BRIEF_001.md);
- [`visual/STYLE_FAMILY_ATLAS_004.md`](visual/STYLE_FAMILY_ATLAS_004.md);
- [`visual/VAPORWAVE_PALETTE_ATLAS_003.md`](visual/VAPORWAVE_PALETTE_ATLAS_003.md);
- [`visual/ICON_AUDIT_MIT_002.md`](visual/ICON_AUDIT_MIT_002.md).

Those documents direct appearance and behavior; they do not override
GUI.Forms, Engine, or Orchestrator contract ownership.

## Fixture boundary

Frontend test ports present replayed capabilities as `simulated`. Fixtures cover:

1. ordinary folder with mixed objects;
2. empty folder;
3. selection, keyboard focus, secondary-but-participating window,
   drag-proximity, and genuinely deactivated-surface distinctions;
4. Orchestrator ready, degraded, unavailable, and incompatible;
5. Engine ready, stale, rebuilding, unavailable, and direct-fallback-eligible;
6. plugins and semantic facts explicitly `stubbed`;
7. long names, deep paths, dense content, narrow windows, and 125–200% scale.

The Orchestrator scenarios replay its canonical Core 1.0 fixtures; other fixture
schemas are application test data and do not freeze a provider ABI.

## Exit gate

Frontend 001 is complete when:

- it builds from a clean tree against only the named GUI.Forms snapshot and
  declared ordinary build dependencies;
- all Engine/provider-absence scenarios run without an Engine process;
- product bootstrap negotiates successfully with the live Core 1.0 daemon,
  while deterministic tests pass against its canonical replay fixtures;
- headless traces for construction, focus, navigation intent, pane collapse,
  resize, activation, and shutdown are deterministic;
- no frontend code includes GUI.Forms private headers or provider-private
  Engine/Orchestrator types;
- unavailable auxiliary services never block window input or local navigation
  state;
- every shipped external or derived visual asset has a pinned provenance and
  license record;
- key/secondary-participating/deactivated, selection/focus, high-contrast,
  reduced-motion, and scale behavior are either demonstrated or explicitly
  recorded as blocked by the named GUI.Forms snapshot;
- the DNA debt ledger is updated with measured implementation findings rather
  than silently resolved by code.

## Explicit exclusions

001 does not require real filesystem mutation, real indexed search, settings
writes, handler invocation, plugin workers, semantic facts, installer/signing,
or daily-use replacement. It does require the live Orchestrator Core 1.0
bootstrap surface and must not claim later capabilities from fixtures.

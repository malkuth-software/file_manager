# File Manager end-of-day checkpoint

Resume note (2026-10-03 UTC): the owner explicitly resumed after reboot. This
document remains the historical pause receipt. PR 9 subsequently passed both
native matrices, merged as `8f20cca` with identical tested tree, and was published
as `v0.001-alpha.8147368`. Coverage follow-up evidence and remaining scope are
recorded in `../results/2026-10-03-search-coverage/README.md`.

2026-10-02. **GIVEN:** owner explicitly paused the active goal and requested a
report and commit because the machine is out of time. Goal is paused, not
complete. No shutdown operation was requested or performed.

## Delivered and pending

- Public dogfood remains `v0.001-alpha.0873f9c`: PNG/text preview repairs,
  separate preview coverage caption, factual Details columns and earlier
  viewport/responsiveness fixes. Portable alpha limitations remain; this is not
  a production installer release or general media-preview/thumbnail support.
- PR 8 is merged at `8f84952`: obsolete queued search jobs retire at service
  boundaries. It is not yet in the public package above.
- PR 9, frozen source `81473681782555fd1cd3b949273b4bcf74a882f6`, moves search
  filesystem observation and row preparation off the UI thread. All 12 local
  suites passed before that commit. Paired component measurements and limits
  are in `../results/2026-10-02-search-publication/README.md`.
- At pause, both PR 9 Linux jobs and the push macOS job passed; the PR macOS
  and both Windows jobs were still pending. Runs: `36997543145` and
  `36997653188`. Resume by inspecting these exact runs, not starting duplicates.
  PR 9 remains open; no new release has been published from it.

## Current unverified checkpoint

Branch `codex/file-manager-search-provenance` starts from the frozen PR 9 source.
This checkpoint adds an owned optional page-coverage projection to the C++
client: stale roots, unavailable roots/paths, warnings and live scan identity.
Missing/null fields remain unreported; malformed typed lists reject projection.
A private parsing seam and focused projection checks were added. No wire
operation, capability, provider route or identity-comparison policy was added.

Frontend source accumulates coverage gaps across appended pages, resets them on
replacement, discloses cached criteria/current identity not rechecked, and uses
bounded empty-result wording instead of a whole-filesystem no-match claim.
This is **unfinished work**, not an accepted or shipped feature.

The local build was still in progress when the owner paused. On stopping the
session, its final output showed the client library, projection-check executable,
application library, interaction-test executable and File Manager executable
compiled/linked; the command returned zero. Tests were not run for this diff.
The checkpoint must not be described as fully validated. No performance or
native GUI claim attaches to these new coverage changes.

Before promotion, finish:

1. Review the exact diff against `planning/PROGRAMMING_HOUSE_STYLE.md`, including
   retained ownership, optional state, bounds, conversions and repeated work.
   No complete semantic style certification is made for this checkpoint.
2. Run the full matching Windows build/tests and new projection checks; add
   coverage-summary/append/reset and visible application status tests.
3. Finish the canonical Orchestrator/frontend negotiation receipt for preserving
   existing wire facts, and review the sibling's read-only findings.
4. Keep per-result identity, evidence, signed metadata, and current-file versus
   cached-match comparison explicitly open. This checkpoint only preserves page
   annotations; it does not resolve proposal `ENGINE_CATALOGUE_SUBSTRING_001`.
5. Keep PR 9 frozen, verify/download its native artifacts, merge only its tested
   tree, then rebase this separate follow-up and run its own native checks.

Sibling-owned untracked `gui_forms/src/core/text/prepared_window/` and
`gui_forms/tests/prepared_window_input_tests.cpp` are excluded from this commit.
The File Manager audit sibling was told to stop at its current read-only boundary.
Notepad, games and Plan Paint were not assigned shutdown or new work.

Remaining product work still includes thumbnails and wider previews, dynamic
folder-size marks, ribbon refinement, native input-to-present responsiveness,
indexed substring admission/currentness, everyday operations and installers.

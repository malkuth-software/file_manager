# File Manager

The pre-architecture workspace for a fast, local-first, cross-platform file
manager: visually descended from classic Windows Explorer, NeXTSTEP, and
Watercolor, with a local CLI surface and future capability-scoped plugin AI.

The parent product remains in **pre-plan** where decisions are unresolved, but
its repository topology, engine spine, Orchestrator integration authority, and
negotiated delivery order are now accepted. The unified suite/distribution is
named **Malkuth** under ADR-012; File Manager remains the application name. The
work in [`planning/`](planning/) defines the remaining decisions, evidence,
exclusions, and component gates.

Start with:

- [`planning/README.md`](planning/README.md) — current phase and artifact map;
- [`planning/PROGRAM_MAP.md`](planning/PROGRAM_MAP.md) — component ownership,
  current permissions, contract authority, and build order;
- [`malkuth/`](malkuth/) — Curious/Concise/Friendly mission, release horizons,
  documentation, installer, website, and release-manifest planning;
- [`planning/PREPLAN_CHARTER.md`](planning/PREPLAN_CHARTER.md) — the plan for
  producing the actual project plan;
- [`planning/EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md`](planning/EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md) — Zeta
  search research, BFFT research discipline, and Modern.Forms reconnaissance;
- [`planning/ARCHITECTURE_INPUTS.md`](planning/ARCHITECTURE_INPUTS.md) — recorded
  constraints and positive product direction from the architect;
- [`planning/SURFACE_PIPELINE.md`](planning/SURFACE_PIPELINE.md) — native retained
  UI pipeline hypothesis, including a possible Modern.Forms compatibility layer;
- [`planning/QUESTION_ATLAS.md`](planning/QUESTION_ATLAS.md) — numbered
  anti-requirement and architecture questions.
- [`frontend/planning/visual/ceremonial-software-atlas.html`](frontend/planning/visual/ceremonial-software-atlas.html)
  — visible accept/distill/reject board for installer animation, OOBE, and
  Visual Studio/professional-software aesthetics from 2000–2012.
- [`frontend/planning/visual/material-depth-atlas.html`](frontend/planning/visual/material-depth-atlas.html)
  — visible static board for relief, instruments, object icons, illustrated
  utility surfaces, and frozen screensaver-pattern families.
- [`planning/gui_forms/GUI_FORMS_BACKEND_DECISION_MAP.md`](planning/gui_forms/GUI_FORMS_BACKEND_DECISION_MAP.md)
  — the technical decision interview for the independent GUI.Forms framework.
- [`planning/gui_forms/GUI_FORMS_INTERVIEW_LEDGER.md`](planning/gui_forms/GUI_FORMS_INTERVIEW_LEDGER.md)
  — GIVEN GUI.Forms constraints, candidate tradeoffs, and the deeper host,
  renderer, layout, and behavior interview; formal selection comes later.
- [`planning/gui_forms/GUI_FORMS_RESOURCES_AND_CONFIGURATION.md`](planning/gui_forms/GUI_FORMS_RESOURCES_AND_CONFIGURATION.md)
  — compiled theme/language packs, PNG policy, safe fallbacks, and mutable
  runtime-configuration candidates.

The fetched Modern.Forms reference is pinned in
[`third_party/README.md`](third_party/README.md).

## Source and build dependencies

Clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules`, or run
`git submodule update --init --recursive` after pulling. GUI.Forms and backend source are pinned submodules
owned by [GUI.Forms](https://github.com/falseywinchnet/gui_forms) and
[backend](https://github.com/falseywinchnet/backend). Make provider changes in
those repositories; update their pins here through a PR against main.

File Manager compiles pinned GUI.Forms source using an optional provider ccache
seed. It consumes exact tested backend binaries instead of rebuilding Go/Rust.
Run `python3 tools/fetch_build_inputs.py --platform macos-arm64` (or `linux-x64`,
`windows-x64`) before `python3 tools/build_native.py --jobs 2`. GitHub CLI is
required for fetching. The lock verifies backend archive and executable hashes.
See [ADR-021](decisions/ADR-021-COMPONENT-REPOSITORIES-AND-BUILD-REUSE.md).

## Program repositories

- [`gui_forms/`](gui_forms/) — independently buildable retained C++ GUI
  framework, currently advancing first toward a semicomplete snapshot.
- [`backend/engine/`](backend/engine/) — purpose-built, standalone Go catalogue/index/search
  service with a narrow versioned API, mandatory sandbox, exact-identity oracle,
  crash/corruption testing, and comparison benchmarks against mature stores.
- [`kolmogrov/`](kolmogrov/) — independent formal and experimental program for
  ConeDAG successors, practical algorithmic-information measures, exhaustive
  breakdown, and fixed-width multi-channel perceptual hashes. It pursues proof
  closure and adversarial measurement before production promotion.
- [`backend/orchestrator/`](backend/orchestrator/) — the active user-scoped Rust Orchestrator:
  canonical integration authority, contract and availability registry, CLI,
  and future owner of hives, settings, handlers, commands, platform policy, and
  hostile plugin supervision. It advances headlessly toward Core 1.0 without a
  GUI.Forms dependency.
- [`frontend/`](frontend/) — the C++ end-user application. Frontend 001 begins
  after Orchestrator Core 1.0, the named GUI.Forms go-ahead, and explicit
  architect direction. Engine and later providers retain separate gates.
- [`paint/`](paint/) — interview-first planning for the future classic direct
  image editor and alpha clipart/composite workflow; implementation gated.
- [`text_editor/`](text_editor/) — interview-first planning for the future
  tabless plain-text/configuration editor; implementation gated.
- [`games/`](games/) — planning-only deterministic game collection and
  GUI.Forms dogfood program; implementation gated.
- [`lexicon/`](lexicon/) — planning-only local dictionary/corpus provider and
  Shakespeare-first Crossword source; implementation gated.
- [`malkuth/`](malkuth/) — planning-only suite release program for 1.0/2.0/3.0,
  cross-platform installers, online documentation, and polished public website.
- [`plugin_runtime/`](plugin_runtime/) — frozen earlier plugin-containment
  research retained as input to Orchestrator, not a parallel runtime implementation.

Each directory contains its own `AGENTS.md`, build boundary, ledgers, acceptance
gates, and a handoff prompt suitable for a dedicated Codex task.

Accepted architecture records are indexed in
[`decisions/README.md`](decisions/README.md). Engine workers must also read both
[`engine/docs/ARCHITECT_HANDOFF_001.md`](engine/docs/ARCHITECT_HANDOFF_001.md)
and [`engine/docs/ARCHITECT_HANDOFF_002.md`](engine/docs/ARCHITECT_HANDOFF_002.md).

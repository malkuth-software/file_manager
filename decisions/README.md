# Accepted architecture decisions

Decision records are authoritative only when their status is **accepted** and
their owner approval names the grand architect's direction. Candidate research
and existing implementation do not silently create decisions.

| Record | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| [`ADR-001-ENGINE-REFERENCE-AND-STORAGE-SPINE.md`](ADR-001-ENGINE-REFERENCE-AND-STORAGE-SPINE.md) | accepted | Go engine object/binding model, root/volume topology, immutable-generation storage spine, observation/publication policy, structures, ranking baseline, migration, API projections, external/network placement, large-directory mode, and initial performance constitution |

| [`ADR-015-ENGINE-M4-DOGFOOD-ROOT-ADMISSION-AND-LAUNCHD.md`](ADR-015-ENGINE-M4-DOGFOOD-ROOT-ADMISSION-AND-LAUNCHD.md) | accepted; named M4 installed evidence passed | Host-bound Engine root manifest, per-user launchd supervision, authenticated query/admin sockets, and exact reversal scope |
| [`ADR-016-FILE-MANAGER-WEB-FORMS-AUTHORING-AND-GUI-FORMS-RUNTIME.md`](ADR-016-FILE-MANAGER-WEB-FORMS-AUTHORING-AND-GUI-FORMS-RUNTIME.md) | accepted for implementation and M4 dogfood | Web.Forms browser-valid build-time authoring compiled fail-closed into the sole retained native GUI.Forms runtime |
| [`ADR-017-PROTECTED-FILE-OPERATION-ORACLE-AND-UNDO.md`](ADR-017-PROTECTED-FILE-OPERATION-ORACLE-AND-UNDO.md) | accepted for protected-root implementation and M4 fault dogfood | Explicit mutation opt-in, no-follow filesystem identity, collision refusal, recoverable same-volume quarantine, and one-step identity-checked undo |

| [`ADR-019-CONTAINED-ENGINE-ADAPTER-AND-IDENTITY-BOUND-SERVICE-CONTROLS.md`](ADR-019-CONTAINED-ENGINE-ADAPTER-AND-IDENTITY-BOUND-SERVICE-CONTROLS.md) | accepted for File Manager 1.0 contained M4 dogfood | Host-bound contained Engine deployment, installed authenticated adapter, typed service snapshots, and instance-bound closed administrative commands |
| [`ADR-020-FILE-MANAGER-TRUSTED-LOCAL-ACTIONS-PREVIEWS-AND-PICKER-PACKAGE.md`](ADR-020-FILE-MANAGER-TRUSTED-LOCAL-ACTIONS-PREVIEWS-AND-PICKER-PACKAGE.md) | accepted for File Manager 1.0 protected-root implementation and M4 dogfood | Bounded first-party SHA-256/preview/native launch actions, source-bound Engine pagination, and independently installed GUI.Forms Document Picker package |

| [`ADR-021-COMPONENT-REPOSITORIES-AND-BUILD-REUSE.md`](ADR-021-COMPONENT-REPOSITORIES-AND-BUILD-REUSE.md) | accepted for implementation | Three repositories, GUI.Forms source/cache consumption, and pinned Rust/Go backend bundles |

Each record retains its alternatives, consequences, reversal path, and
unresolved implementation edges. Engine workers consume ADR-001 through
`../engine/docs/ARCHITECT_HANDOFF_001.md`, the retained Kolmogrov/semantic
boundary through `../engine/docs/ARCHITECT_HANDOFF_002.md`, current integration
authority through ADR-003, the Core 1.0 gate through ADR-006, and the frozen
Engine semantic-v0 handoff through ADR-007, as corrected for required live
search by ADR-008, and the Engine negotiation ledger.

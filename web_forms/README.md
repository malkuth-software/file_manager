# Web.Forms

Status: **Python two-stage dogfood plus fail-closed native-tree experiment open
under ADR-003 and ADR-004**.

Web.Forms is the proposed design-time authoring and compilation companion to
GUI.Forms. An author writes ordinary browser-valid HTML and CSS inside a strict,
versioned subset. A compiler validates the document, resolves its bounded
cascade and layout/style vocabulary, and emits dense C++ construction plus
static GUI.Forms schema, style, resource, and typed-handle records.

The target application is an ordinary retained GUI.Forms program. The current
dogfood emits a compile-checked descriptor, separate manifest-backed component
projections, and a complete experimental typed control tree. The whole tree is
refused if any required record lacks an exact native projection:

```text
*.wf.html + *.wf.css
        |
        v
Stage 1: accept/reject -> typed, versioned *.wfir.json
        |
        v
Stage 2: IR only -> orthodox C++17 descriptor + typed handles
        |          + geometry / typography / material / state / decoration
        |          + explicit GUI.Forms capability report
        +
        +--> experimental exact material projection
        |      -> GUI.Forms retained fills/borders/shadows
        |      -> retained hot/pressed/disabled/focus recipes
        |      -> per-style refusal report for inexact geometry
        |
        +--> exact native component projections
        |      -> surface/state/inset-shadow recipes
        |      -> flex + grid tracks/cells + bounded boxes
        |      -> retained typography + owned pseudo-decoration
        |
        v
experimental typed NativeForm -> GUI.Forms retained controls + private CPU Skia
```

There is no browser or HTML/CSS parser in the product runtime. Application code
attaches ordinary typed GUI.Forms handlers to generated handles; it does not run
or translate JavaScript.

## Accepted authoring boundary

Use HTML and CSS only as authored design source, with no JavaScript. Do not omit
interaction *states*: `hover`, `pressed`, keyboard focus, disabled, selected,
checked, expanded, and popup-visible need declarative visual specimens because
they are part of WYSIWYG. The preview tool selects those states externally; the
source does not simulate application logic.

Keep responsibilities distinct:

- `id` is stable retained identity and generates the C++ handle tree;
- ordinary `class` tokens select reusable visual recipes;
- reserved `wf-*` class tokens may carry Boolean compiler traits;
- typed `data-wf-*` attributes carry values and references that do not belong
  in CSS;
- C++ owns domain behavior, commands, models, validation, and side effects.

The current non-CSS visual/topology lane is intentionally small:

- `data-wf-connected-axis="horizontal|vertical"` applies only to a container
  with two through 256 direct button/drop-down children;
- responsive-track, split-view and command-overflow attributes encode bounded
  retained layout policy, while `data-wf-window-drag-region` identifies
  authored native-chrome drag surfaces;
- dropdown controls carry explicit mode and optional bounded disclosure width;
- `data-wf-keylines` is an ordered, semicolon-separated list of at most eight
  `edge #rrggbb[aa] width inset` records;
- `data-wf-image-list`, `data-wf-image-key`, `data-wf-image-src`, optional
  `data-wf-image-src-2x`, and logical width/height admit source-local canonical
  PNGs only. Stage 1 bounds dimensions, count and bytes and includes the image
  bytes in source identity; Stage 2 emits the `ImageList` registration.

These attributes are compiler semantics, not JavaScript hooks. Ordinary raw
HTML does not execute connected-stock, priority-collapse or generated
`ImageList` behavior; the fidelity oracle records that preview boundary.

The nested source tree is also semantic input. Each child receives a compiled
ambient layout, surface, typography, theme, accommodation, and effective-state
context from its parent. The native result must preserve that landscape rather
than placing independently painted controls over an approximate background.

SVG is visual-resource input, not a second structure language. Inline SVG trees
are rejected in the 0.1 dogfood profile. A later closed local SVG asset may
paint one HTML/CSS-laid image box, but its descendants cannot become controls,
layout nodes, IDs, states, or hit targets. Relational decoration such as a
breadcrumb chevron remains CSS geometry owned by its box.

The compiler is a build-time Python tool. Stage 1 accepts/rejects source and
emits versioned IR; Stage 2 consumes only that IR and emits C++17-compatible
source in the orthodox generated profile. Python is absent from the product
runtime.

Web.Forms does not copy or execute it at runtime.
